Scan QR code!\"\n      - \"Dear Mrs. Smith, NHS: 123456789 - All 65+ residents eligible for free flu vaccine. Book at [URL]\"\n      - \"Dear ((firstName)), You haven't attended bowel cancer screening. Order free test kit now!\"\n    * General health promotion campaigns with strong CTA, even if targeted to cohorts (non-attenders, age groups, geographical areas)\n\n    Examples of Ineligible Mailings (BUSINESS):\n    * Bills, statements, or order confirmations\n    * Subscription or member-only publications\n    * Fulfillment items such as loyalty cards, tickets, or invitations already purchased\n    * Census or data profiling surveys\n    * Shareholder reports or AGM notices\n    * Individual appointment confirmations with specific dates/times:\n      - \"Your appointment is on ((appointmentDate)) at 2pm with Dr. Smith\"\n    * Individual test results:\n      - \"Your HbA1c result is 7.2%, which indicates...\"\n    * Individual medical advice:\n      - \"Based on your diabetes diagnosis, you need to...\"\n    * Letters referencing individual medical conditions beyond cohort membership:\n      - \"You have asthma and diabetes. You need flu vaccine because of your conditions.\"\n\n    Additional Rules of Thumb:\n    * FOCUS ON CONTENT, NOT IDENTIFIERS: NHS numbers and merge fields are acceptable if content is uniform\n    * Surface personalization (name/address/NHS number) does not disqualify if content is uniform and generic\n    * Cohort membership (\"you haven't attended screening\") is NOT individual medical content\n    * Strong CTA (QR code, booking link, phone) strengthens AdMail eligibility\n    * If the message CONTENT differs for each person (individual conditions, results, appointments), it's BUSINESS\n    * If the message CONTENT is uniform (same screening invitation for all non-attenders), it's ADVERTISING\n    </royal_mail_guidance>\n\n    <letter_effectiveness_assessment>\n    Effective Letter Design Best Practices:\n\n    CRITICAL: You must analyze the ACTUAL letter content, not just provide generic advice.\n\n    Call to Action (CTA) Assessment - ANALYZE THE ACTUAL LETTER:\n    * Research shows readers scan letters, focusing first on the top-right area\n    * Identify if the letter HAS a clear CTA or not\n    * Evaluate CTA strength: Is it actionable and specific?\n    * Weak CTA examples to IDENTIFY: \"available to you\", \"you may wish to\", \"you can\", \"information provided\"\n    * Strong CTA examples: \"Book now\", \"Call [number] to schedule\", \"Scan QR code to register\", \"Visit [URL] today\"\n\n    When analyzing CTAs in a letter:\n    * Quote the actual CTA text from the letter if present\n    * Identify what's missing if no clear CTA exists\n    * Explain why the existing CTA is weak (too vague, no clear action, buried in text)\n    * Provide specific improvements based on the letter's purpose\n\n    Optimal Letter Layout (Based on 3M Research):\n    * Top-right: Recipient name and address area (first focus point)\n    * Top-right or prominent: QR code for easy digital engagement\n    * Left side: Summary text with clear benefits\n    * Center: Main message with clear structure\n    * Bottom: Multiple CTA options (QR, phone, web, email)\n\n    Professional NHS Communication Standards:\n    * Use \"GP practice\" or \"Practice Manager\" instead of individual doctor names for uniformity\n    * Include clear eligibility criteria\n    * Explain WHY someone is receiving the communication\n    * Use plain English suitable for diverse audiences\n    * Include accessibility options (phone, online, in-person)\n    </letter_effectiveness_assessment>\n\n    3.
