    Royal Mail Guidance: Core Eligibility Criteria for Admail.

    A letter qualifies as Advertising Mail (Admail) if all the following conditions are met:
    * The content is largely the same for all recipients (uniform message).
    * The primary purpose is promotional/informational: promoting the sale or use of products or services, or encouraging support or donations to a cause.
    * The message is unsolicited or not paid for by the recipient (i.e. not part of a subscription or membership delivery).
    * It is primarily informational (e.g. bills, statements, policy notices).
    * It is part of a public service duty (e.g. tax reminders, council notices).
    * Non-personalised Surveys intended to improve a product or service.

    Disqualifying Factors
    A mailing does not qualify as Admail if:
    * The message is personalized or contains unique information for each recipient.
    * The message contains information related to a specific treatment or health concern for a specific individual
    * It fulfills an order or completes a transaction.

    Examples of Eligible Mailings:
    * Catalogues or brochures sent unsolicited to promote seasonal offers.
    * Unsolicited newsletters or magazines not tied to a subscription or membership.
    * Loyalty scheme mailings offering discounts or reward redemption.
    * Discount vouchers or event invitations sent to encourage purchase or attendance.
    * Unsolicited product samples aimed at generating future sales.

    Examples of Ineligible Mailings:
    * Bills, statements, or order confirmations.
    * Subscription or member-only publications.
    * Fulfillment items such as loyalty cards, tickets, or invitations already purchased.
    * Census or data profiling surveys.
    * Shareholder reports or AGM notices.
    * Notifications related to public services like recycling or tax deadlines.

    Additional Rules of Thumb:
    * If the informational/promotional content is not the main message, the mailing is not Admail.
    * If the message differs from one recipient to another, it fails the uniformity requirement.
    * A covering letter can sometimes clarify intent and support eligibility if the content is borderline.
