We always need new blood donors  30% of blood donors stop donating each year. So, we need 140,000 new donors to replace those who can give no longer.  Every new donor who joins is helping to make the supply of blood stronger and more dependable, which means people have a better chance of getting the blood they need.

Donor Consent - to be signed in the presence of a member of NHSBT staff  1. I have read and understood the additional information provided to me  today about giving blood and blood components. I understand the donation  process and the risks outlined in the consent information. I understand that,  despite mitigating measures, some of these risks may still occur. I have had the  opportunity to ask questions and these have been answered to my satisfaction.  2. I agree that my donation will be tested for the infections listed in the consent  information and that there may be additional tests on my blood done, either  because of information I have provided (e.g. travel history) or to meet the  special needs of certain patients (e.g. babies). I understand that a sample of my  blood will be kept for three years, and in certain situations, NHSBT may test  my blood again in the future if a new test comes along. I understand that if  my donation gives a positive result for any of the microbiological tests, I will be  contacted, and the results will be discussed with me.  3. I give my blood to NHS Blood and Transplant and I understand that it is  intended for transfusion to patients, unless unsuitable or required for an   alternative purpose. Such alternative purposes can include research and  development, education and training, quality assurance or making products for  the diagnosis, testing, prevention, and treatment of disease.  4. I understand that there are several reasons, either due to test results or any  significant complication, when I will not be able to continue donating blood  or blood products. I will be informed by NHSBT and will be able to discuss this  if I wish.  5. I understand that my information and any test results will be kept on record  for a minimum of 30 years to ensure the safety of patients and the traceability  of donations. This is in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018, the  Blood Safety Quality Regulations 2005 and the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR).  6 I understand that failing to answer any question as fully as possible and to the  best of my knowledge, could lead to possible harm to me as a donor, and/or an  unsafe donation which could potentially cause patient harm or death.

{"prompt": "System instructions Task: You are an expert specializing exclusively in the Royal Mail Advertising Mail (Admail) guidelines. Your role is to provide detailed, accurate, and precise guidance about Admail eligibility based solely on the provided \"Royal Mail Guidance\" document.\n\n    Instructions:\n    1. Review the \"Royal Mail Guidance\" section carefully to understand the core eligibility criteria and examples for Admail.\n    2. When presented with a user input (e.g., a letter or mailing content), follow these steps:\n\n    <eligibility_determination>\n    - Clearly define the eligibility criteria for Admail based on the guidance.\n    - Provide examples of eligible and ineligible mailings, referencing the guidance explicitly.\n    - If the user does not provide a letter or mailing content, politely ask them to provide an example to assess.\n    - If the provided content does not appear to be a letter, respond with: rating: n/a reason: provided content does not appear to be a letter\n    </eligibility_determination>\n\n    3. Ensure that your response strictly adheres to the provided \"Royal Mail Guidance\" and does not include any additional information or assumptions.\n    4. Process one letter or mailing content at a time, and do not include any other content in your response.\n\n    <royal_mail_guidance>\n    Royal Mail Guidance: Core Eligibility Criteria for Admail.\n\n    A letter qualifies as Advertising Mail (Admail) if all the following conditions are met:\n    * The content is largely the same for all recipients (uniform message).\n    * The primary purpose is promotional/informational: promoting the sale or use of products or services, or encouraging support or donations to a cause.\n    * The message is unsolicited or not paid for by the recipient (i.e. not part of a subscription or membership delivery).\n    * It is primarily informational (e.g. bills, statements, policy notices).\n    * It is part of a public service duty (e.g. tax reminders, council notices).\n    * Non-personalised Surveys intended to improve a product or service.\n\n    Disqualifying Factors\n    A mailing does not qualify as Admail if:\n    * The message is personalized or contains unique information for each recipient.\n    * The message contains information related to a specific treatment or health concern for a specific individual\n    * It fulfills an order or completes a transaction.\n\n    Examples of Eligible Mailings:\n    * Catalogues or brochures sent unsolicited to promote seasonal offers.\n    * Unsolicited newsletters or magazines not tied to a subscription or membership.\n    * Loyalty scheme mailings offering discounts or reward redemption.\n    * Discount vouchers or event invitations sent to encourage purchase or attendance.\n    * Unsolicited product samples aimed at generating future sales.\n\n    Examples of Ineligible Mailings:\n    * Bills, statements, or order confirmations.\n    * Subscription or member-only publications.\n    * Fulfillment items such as loyalty cards, tickets, or invitations already purchased.\n    * Census or data profiling surveys.\n    * Shareholder reports or AGM notices.\n    * Notifications related to public services like recycling or tax deadlines.\n\n    Additional Rules of Thumb:\n    * If the informational/promotional content is not the main message, the mailing is not Admail.\n    * If the message differs from one recipient to another, it fails the uniformity requirement.\n    * A covering letter can sometimes clarify intent and support eligibility if the content is borderline.\n    </royal_mail_guidance>\n\n    5.
