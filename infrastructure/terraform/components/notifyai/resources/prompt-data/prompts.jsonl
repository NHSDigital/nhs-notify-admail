Please arrange and attend this important appointment. As you have been diagnosed with diabetes, we have arranged for you to have a diabetic eye screening test. This looks for early signs of diabetic retinopathy - an eye condition that can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. When diabetic eye retinopathy is caught early, treatment is effective at reducing or preventing damage to your sight. You may not be aware of changes to your vision even if you have the early stages of the condition. What you need to do for your appointment When you attend your appointment, drops will be put into your eyes which may sting slightly and will affect your vision. Because of this please: do not drive until your vision returns to normal, which can take up to 6 hours; think about bringing someone with you to help and support you after the appointment; think about bringing sunglasses, as your eyes may be sensitive to light following screening.  Also, if you have prescription (distance/reading) glasses, please bring them with you.  Your appointment will take [insert amount of time]. Please call us on [insert tel no] if you: are already seeing an eye specialist and want to check if you still need to attend screening have any concerns about screening or do not want to be screened.  We will send your screening result to you and your GP practice within 3 weeks of your appointment. If you have any questions about your result, you can contact us at the telephone number above.  More information This screening only tests for diabetic retinopathy. It is not the same as your regular eye test with your optometrist or optician. You should have both tests. You can find more information about what happens at the appointment, diabetic retinopathy and how to manage your diabetes at www.nhs.uk/diabeticeye. You can also scan this QR code with the camera on your smartphone or tablet.

As you have been diagnosed with diabetes, we have arranged for you to have a diabetic eye screening test. This looks for early signs of diabetic retinopathy - an eye condition that can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. When diabetic eye retinopathy is caught early, treatment is effective at reducing or preventing damage to your sight. You may not be aware of changes to your vision even if you have the early stages of the condition. What you need to do for your appointment When you attend your appointment, drops will be put into your eyes which may sting slightly and will affect your vision. Because of this please: do not drive until your vision returns to normal, which can take up to 6 hours; think about bringing someone with you to help and support you after the appointment; think about bringing sunglasses, as your eyes may be sensitive to light following screening.  Also, if you have prescription (distance/reading) glasses, please bring them with you.  Your appointment will take [insert amount of time]. Please call us on [insert tel no] if you: cannot make this appointment are already seeing an eye specialist and want to check if you still need to attend screening have any concerns about screening or do not want to be screened.  We will send your screening result to you and your GP practice within 3 weeks of your appointment. If you have any questions about your result, you can contact us at the telephone number above.  More information This screening only tests for diabetic retinopathy. It is not the same as your regular eye test with your optometrist or optician. You should have both tests.

Donor Consent - to be signed in the presence of a member of NHSBT staff  1. I have read and understood the additional information provided to me  today about giving blood and blood components. I understand the donation  process and the risks outlined in the consent information. I understand that,  despite mitigating measures, some of these risks may still occur. I have had the  opportunity to ask questions and these have been answered to my satisfaction.  2. I agree that my donation will be tested for the infections listed in the consent  information and that there may be additional tests on my blood done, either  because of information I have provided (e.g. travel history) or to meet the  special needs of certain patients (e.g. babies). I understand that a sample of my  blood will be kept for three years, and in certain situations, NHSBT may test  my blood again in the future if a new test comes along. I understand that if  my donation gives a positive result for any of the microbiological tests, I will be  contacted, and the results will be discussed with me.  3. I give my blood to NHS Blood and Transplant and I understand that it is  intended for transfusion to patients, unless unsuitable or required for an   alternative purpose. Such alternative purposes can include research and  development, education and training, quality assurance or making products for  the diagnosis, testing, prevention, and treatment of disease.  4. I understand that there are several reasons, either due to test results or any  significant complication, when I will not be able to continue donating blood  or blood products. I will be informed by NHSBT and will be able to discuss this  if I wish.  5. I understand that my information and any test results will be kept on record  for a minimum of 30 years to ensure the safety of patients and the traceability  of donations. This is in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018, the  Blood Safety Quality Regulations 2005 and the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR).  6 I understand that failing to answer any question as fully as possible and to the  best of my knowledge, could lead to possible harm to me as a donor, and/or an  unsafe donation which could potentially cause patient harm or death.

This means there are changes to the small blood vessels on the macula, the central part of the retina at the back of your eye. Please don't be alarmed. Although there's a higher risk that your vision could eventually be affected, it's not too late to stop it getting worse if you manage your diabetes well.  What happens next These changes may need treatment, so we are referring you to the Hospital Eye Clinic to see a specialist. The hospital will send you an appointment.  It is important that you attend this appointment in order to protect your eyesight.  We have sent your test result to your GP practice. If you have any questions about this test result, please contact the screening service on [insert number]. Please also contact the screening service if you have not received your Hospital Eye Clinic appointment within 13 weeks. Diabetic eye screening is a specific test for people with diabetes. It is not the same as your regular eye test with your optometrist or optician. You should continue to have both tests.If you notice any changes to your eyesight, such as worsening of vision, blurred vision, or eye pain, contact your local optometrist or optician straight away. Do not wait for your next screening appointment.
